{
	/**
	 * Calculates how many (doubled) movement points it will take to move from x, y to ever other location on the map plus whether we can move there or not
	 * MoM is a little weird with how movement works - providing you have even 1/2 move left, you can move anywhere, even somewhere which takes 3 movement to get to
	 * e.g. a unit on a road with 1 movement can walk onto the road (1/2 mp), and then into mountains (3 mp) for a total move of 3 1/2 mp even thought they only had 1 movement!
	 * Therefore knowing distances to each location is not enough - we need a separate boolean array to mark whether we can or cannot reach each location
	 *
	 * @param startX X coordinate of location to move from
	 * @param startY Y coordinate of location to move from
	 * @param startPlane Plane to move from
	 * @param movingPlayerID The player who is trying to move here
	 * @param map The player who is trying to move here's knowledge
	 * @param unitStack Which units are actually moving (may be more friendly units in the start tile that are choosing to stay where they are)
	 * @param doubleMovementRemaining The lowest movement remaining for any of the units that are moving
	 * @param doubleMovementDistances Movement required to reach every location on both planes; 0 = can move there for free, negative value = can't move there
	 * @param movementDirections The direction that we moved to get here, e.g. the tile directly above startX, startY will have value 1
	 * @param canMoveToInOneTurn Indicates the locations that we can reach in a single turn (see the forester example above)
	 * @param players List of players in this session
	 * @param sd Session description
	 * @param db Lookup lists built over the XML database
	 * @throws RecordNotFoundException If the tile type or map feature IDs cannot be found
	 * @throws PlayerNotFoundException If we cannot find the player who owns the unit
	 * @throws MomException If the list includes something other than MemoryUnits or ExpandedUnitDetails
