11 - 40% reduction
13 - 60% reduction
15 - 80% reduction
17 - 100% reduction
mastery - 15% reduction
Reductions are capped at 100%, i.e. when spells are free (it does stop costs going -ve)
They give this figure as a BONUS for research rather than a reduction in research cost of spells
Research bonuses are not capped - combined with mastery & sage, tested up to at least 120% bonus
None of these help with upkeep of summoned units, global/city/unit enchantments

conjurer - 25% off casting and maintenance, 25% bonus to research of summoning spells
Maint is rounded up, i.e. 15 maint -> 11.25 -> 12 maint
(So it is possible with 15 spell books & conjurer to cast free summoning spells)

sage - 25% bonus to research

channeler - 50% off maint (round remainder down, i.e. maint 7 -> 3.5 -> maint 3)
channeler DOES reduce cost of unit enchantments and maintance of summoned units, but the unit display in the original MoM doesn't show it
e.g. Storm Giant (10 upkeep) with Wind Walking (10 upkeep) with channeler & conjurer
75% reduction on the Storm Giant = 2.5 = 3, 50% reduction on Wind Walking = 5, total = 8

Runemaster gives 25% off Arcane, but this can never be a problem since even for Magic Spirits the reduction may be:
Runemaster 25% + Conjurer 25% = 50% off

Heroes:
Verified that Conjurer has no effect on researching, casting or upkeep of Summon Hero, even though its a Summoning Spell
Verified that Conjurer has no effect on lowering casting cost of Torin, however it (rather oddly) does reduce his upkeep
