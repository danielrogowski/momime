/**
 * Server sends this to clients to tell them about a new unit added to the map, or can add them in bulk as part of fogOfWarVisibleAreaChanged.
 * 
 * If readSkillsFromXML is true, client will read unit skills from the XML database (otherwise the client, receiving a message with zero skills, cannot tell if it is a hero who
 * genuinely has no skills (?) or is expected to read in the skills from the XML database).
 * 
 * If skills are included, the Experience value is not used so is omitted, since the Experience value will be included in the skill list.
 * 
 * Bulk adds (fogOfWarVisibleAreaChanged) can contain a mixture of units with and without skill lists included.
