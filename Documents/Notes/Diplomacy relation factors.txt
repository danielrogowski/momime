Calc of starting relation works as per wiki (not like original MoM, but as per suggested improvements on wiki)

Positive factors (none of these apply if they've ever started casting SoM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+10 for forming a wizard pact
+20 for forming an alliance
+10 for a peace treaty
+15 if you agree to their request to declare war or break alliance with another wizard
+3 for each successive turn a wizard pact is maintained
+6 for each successive turn an alliance is maintained
+5,10,15,20 for gold dontations of each level
+10,20,30,40 for spell donations of each realm (10=commons, 40 = very rares)
+4,8,12,16 for spell trades, keyed by the realm of the spell that the AI player got
+1 for each turn with Aura of Majesty cast

Negative factors
--------------------
-1 for each unit in in territory limits (a slightly wider range than the city resource area) so a stack of 9 gives -9; doubled if they are within city resource area
-10 if you ask them to declare war or break alliance with another wizard, even if they agree
-10 for casting something nasty on our units outside of a city (incl units guarding cleared nodes, towers, e.g. black wind, ice storm)
-10 for breaking a wizard pact (nicely, via the diplomacy screen)
-15 for trying but failing to take over one of their nodes
-20 for an attacking units not in a city (incl units guarding cleared nodes, towers)
-20 for each turn for each curse they have on one of our cities
-20 for breaking an alliance (nicely, via the diplomacy screen)
-20 for breaking a wizard pact with no warning by attacking one of their cities (in addition to the -40 or more penalty for attacking the city itself)
-20 for breaking an alliance with no warning by attacking their units not in a city (in addition to the -20 for attacking units outside a city)
-20 for spamming us with proposals after we've ran out of patience to talk to them
-25 for casting any kind of dispelling spell overland at their units or cities (disenchant area, disjunction, spell binding) whether successful or not
-25 with every wizard when subversion is cast on you
-30 for each turn they maintain any particulary nasty overland enchantments (armageddon, great wasting, meteor storm, suppress magic, time stop, crusade, charm of life, planar seal,
	Nature's wrath IF we have death or chaos books, Tranquility IF we have chaos books, Life Force IF we have death books, Eternal night UNLESS we have death books)
-30 for casting something nasty at one of their cities (e.g. earthquake, call the void, black wind, ice storm, corruption + raise volcano + change terrain + transmute within the city radius, maybe others)
-30 for successfully taking over one of their nodes
-30 if you threaten them (no matter what response they pick)
-40 for casting global attack spells (Great Unsummoning, Death Wish)
-40 for attacking a city that isn't their capital and failing to capture it
-40 for casting something nasty at the wizard themselves (cruel unminding + subversion)
-40 for breaking an alliance with no warning by attacking one of their cities (in addition to the -40 or more penalty for attacking the city itself)
-60 for capturing a city that isn't their capital
-80 for attacking their capital and failing to capture it
-200 for capturing their capital and banishing them
-200 (permanently) if they start casting SoM

Other factors
----------------
Each turn, visible relation gravitates towards starting relation by 10%, so if currently 80 and starting is 30, then diff of 50, 10% of that is 5 so changes to 75.  This stops if they've ever started casting SoM.

Cut off values (modified by wizard personality hostility factor)
-----------------
Will agree to a peace treaty if relation >= 0
Will agree to a wizard pact if relation >= 20
Will agree to an alliance if relation >= 40
