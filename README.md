README of original author, Nigel Gay:

This is an attempt at a multiplayer client/server java rewrite of Microprose/Simtex's classic DOS turn based strategy game Master of Magic. Latest versions now require Java 17, however since a lot of folks have been having trouble setting this up, I am now providing 2 versions, one with a JRE included in the download, and one without. Beyond this, it should just be as simple as unzipping the file and running server.bat to get the server running locally, and client.bat to start up the client. See the readme for more details.

The project is effectively finished at this point with no major new features planned. I will still do bug fixes and vulnerability fixes as necessary. 1.6.7 adds roads in combat and several bug fixes.

I am most easily found at the MoM discord server at https://discord.gg/wFNQf36
There is also a forum for MoM IME at http://mom.pjj.cc/forum
Or can message me or raise ticket on SourceForge.
