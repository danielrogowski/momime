Used Java XmiExtract program to get original XMIs
Used Awave Studio to convert XMIs to MIDs which gets the tempo right, which the old DOS XMI2MID was too fast
	-  Awave Studio refuses to open XMIs that include the 16 byte SimTex header so have to strip it off.  Old DOS XMI2MID didn't care about this and read them anyway.
	
Converters:
	- Originally uploaded .MID files to www.solmire.com but this doesn't exist anymore so had to find alternative
	- Keppy's MIDI to MP3 converter is best thing I have found to convert the MIDs, must set volume to 50% or music is way too loud and can hear distortion in some parts.

Used MagicSF2 soundfont for majority of conversions at 50% volume
Used A 340 at 80% volume for combat and diplomacy music
