Used my old Delphi LBXExtract program combined with XMI2MID to extract from .LBXs
Then uploaded .MID files to www.solmire.com
Used MagicSF2 soundfont at 192 KBps for majority of conversions
Used A 340 for all the combat music (MagicSF2 sounded too drummy and didn't handle the fast changing notes well)
PersonalCopy &  Titanic also sound good though haven't used them yet
