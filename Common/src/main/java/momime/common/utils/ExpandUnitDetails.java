	/**
	 * Calculates and stores all derived skill, upkeep and other values for a particular unit and stores them for easy and quick lookup.
	 * Note the calculated values depend in part on which unit(s) we're in combat with and if we're calculating stats for purposes of defending an incoming attack.
	 * e.g. the +2 defence from Long Range will only be included vs incoming ranged attacks; the +3 bonus from Resist Elements will only be included vs incoming Chaos+Nature based attacks
	 * So must bear this in mind that we need to recalculate unit stats again if the circumstances we are calculating them for change, even if the unit itself has not changed.
	 * 
	 * @param unit Unit to expand skill list for
	 * @param enemyUnits List of enemy units who may have skills that negate the skill we're checking for; typically this is the unit we're engaging in an attack with; in some
	 * 	cases such as Invisibility, it may be ALL units we're in combat with; for situations not involved in combats or specific attacks, just pass null here
	 * @param attackFromSkillID The skill ID of the incoming attack, e.g. bonus from Long Range only activates vs ranged attacks;
	 *		null will only count bonuses that apply regardless of the kind of attack being defended against
	 * @param attackFromMagicRealmID The magic realm of the incoming attack, e.g. bonus from Bless only activates vs Death and Chaos-based attacks;
	 *		null will only count bonuses that apply regardless of the kind of attack being defended against
	 * @param players Players list
	 * @param mem Known overland terrain, units, buildings and so on
	 * @param db Lookup lists built over the XML database
	 * @return List of all skills this unit has, with skills granted from other skills and skills granted from spells merged into the list
	 * @throws RecordNotFoundException If the definition of the unit, a skill or spell or so on cannot be found in the db
	 * @throws PlayerNotFoundException If we cannot find the player who owns the unit
	 * @throws MomException If the calculation logic runs into a situation it doesn't know how to deal with
