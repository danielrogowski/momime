	<!-- This is needed by testBuildNewGameDatabase - Spring doesn't like if XML file A imports B and C, and both B and C import D -
			D ends up being included twice.  The MoM server and client beans files import the MoM common beans file, and the multiplayer
			server and client beans files, which in turn import the multiplayer common beans file.  Therefore we can't put an import to the
			multiplayer common beans file in the MoM common beans file.
			
			That means the MoM common beans file can't be fired up in isolation - so we need this small file which loads both it and
			the multiplayer common beans so the dependencies are satisfied -->
