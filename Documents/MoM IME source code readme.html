<h2>Master of Magic - Implode's Multiplayer Edition - Source code readme</h2>
<p>This is a quick runthrough describing the project structure and necessary steps to build and run MoM IME.  It assumes
you're familiar enough with using SVN, Maven and Eclipse.</p>

<h3>Obtaining the source code</h3>
<p>The MoM IME source code is currently available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/m/momime">Sourceforge - MoM IME</a> and
can be checked out using a command line SVN utility, TortoiseSVN or similar.  Note the default project root Sourceforge provides
in the edit box <code>//svn.code.sf.net/p/momime/code/trunk</code> does not exist, MoMIME is split into separate subprojects
corresponding to each Maven artefact so that each artefact can be separately versioned and the correct dependencies between versions
set in all the project POMs.  Each subproject can be downloaded using SVN from the
path <code>//svn.code.sf.net/p/momime/code/Java/<b>subprojectname</b>/trunk</code>.</p>

<h3>Source code license</h3>
<p>The MoM IME source code is distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License (GPL)</a>.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>
<p>The MoM IME source code is built using Maven 3.x on the command line by building each of the subprojects/artefacts in the following
order.  All other necessary libraries should be automatically downloaded by maven.</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Subproject/artefact</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>NdgParent</td><td>Parent POM referenced by all the other artefacts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgRandom</td><td>Random number generator interface, so random results can be mocked in unit tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMap</td><td>Library for traversing coordinates around square and hex maps and performing operations on them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMultiplayerBase</td><td>Multiplayer layer that allows clients to connect to a server over TCP/IP, and XML objects to be passed between them using JAXB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMultiplayerSessionBase</td><td>Adds to NdgMultiplayerBase concept of sessions (game instances).  The server stores a user
	registry; users must log on, start a session, others can then join, and clients in the same session have knowledge
	about each other leaving and joining the session.  The state of each session is designed to be entirely contained so it can be persisted (i.e. save game files).  This
	basically defines the messaging layer to support all this, with no implementation.
	<br/>This is still hub-and-spoke architecture - clients have no direct connections to each other - if one client in a session
	needs to send a message to another client, it must send the message to the server and code must be written on the server that
	knows to bounce that message to the destination client.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMultiplayerSessionServer</td><td>Server-side implementation of NdgMultiplayerSessionBase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMultiplayerSessionClient</td><td>Client-side implementation of NdgMultiplayerSessionBase.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgUtils</td><td>General purpose utils lib, especially for Swing screen layouts.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMECommon</td><td>Common code shared by the MoM IME Java server and client.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMEServer</td><td>Main MoM IME Java server code.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMEClient</td><td>Main MoM IME Java client code.  Note this is in the most part empty for now as the current client will still be
	based in Delphi, however there is a dummy Java client in /src/test/java/momime.client.dummy which can be used to simulate
	network messages to/from the MoM IME client in order to test out the server.  See "General project direction" below.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan=2><br/><br/></td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgXmlEditor</td><td>Generic XML editor which uses info from XSDs to build forms with fields based on all the XSD type
	defintions.  Forms are customisable as necessary.  All the MoM IME editors are extensions based on this.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMEUtils</td><td>Helper classes for dealing with original MoM and MoM IME file formats; currently only required by MoMIMEEditors.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMEEditors</td><td>MoM-specific extensions to NdgXmlEditor to allow editing all the XML files used by the game.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Other SVN checkouts</h3>

<p>The following are other subprojects under the main Java folder in the SVN repository, but that are not maven artefacts used to build the main project:</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Subproject/artefact</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMultiplayerBaseDemo</td><td>Exmaple server and client based on NdgMultiplayerBase so that this can be tested in isolation from session semantics.</td></tr>
<tr><td>NdgMultiplayerSessionDemo</td><td>Exmaple server and client based on NdgMultiplayerSessionBase so that this can be tested in isolation from MoM.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMEDocuments</td><td>Documents about building, developing, running, editing MoM IME and so on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>MoMIMEMiscellanous</td><td>Eclipse formatting files, reference material like screen layouts and documentation from the original Master of Magic, installation project and completed installation files for end users.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Editing</h3>
<p>MoM IME is developed using the latest version of Eclipse (currently 3.7/Indigo) with the following plugins (installed using Help - Install New Software from within the Eclipse IDE).  These
are plugins are to support maven artefacts and dependencies within Eclipse:</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><th>Plugin</th><th>URL</th><th>Items to install</th></tr>
<tr><td>subclipse</td><td>http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.8.x</td><td>3 required items to install</td></tr>
<tr><td>m2eclipse 1.1</td><td>http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/milestones/1.1</td><td>1 required item to install</td></tr>
</table>

<p><b>Important: </b>Even if you are using Eclipse which in the most part auto-builds all the code fine, you will still have to
do a complete build of all the projects on the Maven command line first, otherwise Eclipse doesn't find the JAXB episode files.  Eclipse
also regularly gives errors saying "Cannot parse the input schema(s).  Error messages should have been provided", but of course, none
are provided.  This doesn't seem to stop anything from running correctly.</p>

<p>The source code is properly aligned (e.g. tabs) if the editor font in Eclipse is set to <b>Tahoma 10</b> so please use this.  A formatting file is available in
the MoMIMEMiscellaneous project, but even so this is there as a general guildline and so autocomplete on code formats it correctly,
rather than for using the Eclipse autoformat option which will muck up a lot of tab and comment alignments so please don't use it and then check code back in.</p>

<h3>General project direction, and Delphi reference code</h3>
<p>Versions of MoM IME up to 0.9.3.1 were coded entirely in Delphi.  This code is available in SVN under
<code>//svn.code.sf.net/p/momime/code/Delphi/<b>subprojectname</b>/trunk</code>.  The intention is for version 0.9.4, the server to be
ported to Java and the messaging protocol changed to XML based, which is well underway, but for 0.9.4 the old Delphi client will be
retained and modified to 'talk' using the new XML protocol.  From version 0.9.5 the client will also be ported to Java at which point the Delphi
code will become redundant and be removed.  So the Delphi code is in the most part being provided purely as reference material.</p>

<h3>Thread safety - Server</h3>
<p>One of the major problems with the Delphi code, and what killed my first attempt at trying to port the server to Java, is the thread model
that it uses.  Much of the game memory storage involves lists; access to (in the old thread model) which must be synchronized so that one
thread doesn't try to read the list while another is updating it.  Any network app is inherently multi-threaded since, on the server, each
client connection runs in its own thread which blocks until the next message from the client arrives.  So the Delphi code works such that
access to any list from any thread must first lock the list.  Furthermore, because there are hundreds of such lists, the locking must always
be performed in the same order to avoid any chance of deadlocks.  This became unmanageably complicated once I got into methods that required
15-20 lists to be locked simultaneously.  Moreover, I came to the realise that it was all pointless since nearly every method inevitably
needed to lock one of the main lists (e.g. list of players, the map terrain, or so on) and so none of them were going to run concurrently
anyway so I was going to massive effort to try to enable threads to run concurrently with no benefit at all.</p>

<p>So instead, in the new Java server port, I've taken a drastically different approach to thread safety, which is to say that only a single
thread is able to access the entire game world.  Each session has its own thread, so if there are 3 games currently in progress, each of the
3 games will run in its own 'session thread' concurrently since the 3 'game worlds' can be read/updated independantly and concurrently.  As messages arrive on each client connection, those messages are posted onto
the queue for the session thread for whichever session that player is in, and then processed in sequence.  If a player leaves one
session and joins another, the server will simply switch which session thread message queue that player's messages are being posted
to.  All this session thread handling and message queueing is all done inside NdgMultiplayerSessionServer.  Thus none of the code in
MoMIMEServer ever has to worry about thread safety issues.</p>

<h3>Thread safety - Client</h3>

<p>The Java client port will work in much the same way.  The client is simplier in that it only ever has
a single game world to deal with, and a single connection it is receiving messages from (the server), however it is more complicated in
that it has to continually redrawing the screen.  It will avoid thread safety issues by in the most part being single threaded.  That means
it cannot be processing a message from the server at the same time as it is redrawing the screen.</p>

<p>So the client will basically run in an endless loop.  If there is a message from the server to process then do so; otherwise redraw
the screen and loop again.  If a message arrives from the server mid-way through the screen being redrawn, it will be queued up and
processed once the screen redraw completes.  While this might make the appearance slightly jerky if screen redraws freeze momentarily when
big messages are processed, I think its worth that sacrifice to have a thread safety model that is easy to use, and really the client should
not be doing much heavy processing as a result of receiving messages from the server anyway, since all the heavy processing should
be done server-side.</p>

<h3>Eclipse Set-up</h3>
<p>To actually run the server from Eclipse you need a local - not versioned - copy of MoMIMEServerConfig.xml.  In there you put paths to your copies of the server database (versioned 
file found at MoMIMEServerDatabase\src\external\resources\momime.server.database) which can be referenced directly; and user registry (an empty versioned 
file found at NdgMultiplayerSessionServer\src\external\resources\com.ndg.multiplayer.userregistry but you need to take a copy of this to some
other non-versioned location and then reference that from the config file).</p>
