ALL draconian units should get Fire Breath (due to single RAT restriction, in the original Shaman, Magicians, etc. did not)
Similarly Barbarian Bowmen should still have their Thrown attack
Magic type of ranged attacks of summoned creatures should match their realm - so we don't have Storm Giants throwing Chaos lightning bolts
Significantly bump the power of Wall of Fire and Immolation, which are currently just lame
Non-coporeal/Wraithform should make Flight irrelevant, so Wraiths cannot use ench roads but move at double speed

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following should get +2 bonus from node auras
and also from Experience (although the only of these skills that a regular unit has is Poison)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stoning Gaze (Basilisk, Gorgons, Chaos Spawn)
Stoning Touch (Cockatrices)
Poison (Giant Spiders, Great Wyrms, Chaos Spawn, Nagas)
Death Gaze (Chaos Spawn)
Immolation (Doom Bat)

Chaos Channels Fire Breath - debateable - CC fire breath Draconians would then get +2 to BOTH fire breaths
For: This is not unreasonable, they'd get better at using their CC fire breath too
Against: This means defining the power of the Breath attack gained from a spell, which currently isn't supported and then gets into a whole mess of what
to do about things like Elemental Armour - should this show up as Elemental Armour 10 so you can change the strength of it?
